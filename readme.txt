10 days of face-to-face class
20 students maximum. china time 9am-11am 
on enrollment, give a welcome packet:
1. who? (bio of tippi, mentor, tonythetutor and wingbirds)
2. how to have: awesome and fun space to create, share and learn (tippis rule)
3. link to 10 question onboarding survey website (mirrored by last day survey)
4. preparing for class (similar to harry potters requirements for first year wizard school)
5. catalyst for palpable excitement and momentum into first day (mention the scavenger hunt!).

request for my team in CHINA to prepare:
black cool sunglasses with "C.A.DJ.A.A." on one side and "Tippi Fifestarr Presents:" on the other
to all students who submit their first survey.
another surprise gift on last day of class.
